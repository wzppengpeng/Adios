# Adios
## Adios is my new personal c++ project code
+ Adios lib is a network lib(rest api and distributed task queue by
    boost.asio)
+ Aiolos lib is a machine learning engine(use C++11)
+ wzp_cpp_lib is a C++11 lib of basic components

## Useness
+ Users can just use some basic c++ components such as config file parser,command parser or logger and so on;
+ This porject also provides a package of boost.asio for task queue or rest api of c++ codes;
+ The last but not the least, the project provides a machine learning engine which is easy to use with python interface.
